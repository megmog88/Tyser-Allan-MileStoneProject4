# MileStone Project Four- Tyser&Allan "Special Projects"

A project designed for Tyser&Allan who specialise in special projects in regards to landscaping and event
draping. A couple of my good friends have recently joined forces and set up a business and I will now be 
making their website for them. The idea is to show off the amazing work they do and make a fully functioning
website that allows users to get in touch for quotes and/or buy merchandise that they are selling. 

You can get to my live site through the following link [INSERT LINK HERE MEGHAN]

### Color scheme

![Color Scheme](static/images/colors.PNG)

I used a calming neutral set of colors as seen in the image. These colors are inline with
the brand and allow ease of use looking at the site. The color codes are as follows.
#7395AE
#5D5C61
#b1a296

I moved away from the green color from this picture as it wasn't very pleasing to the eye.

### Typogrophy
Robotto, it works perfectly for my project as I didn't need anything fancy.
