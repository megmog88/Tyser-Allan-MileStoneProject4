# MileStone Project Four- Tyser&Allan "Special Projects"

A project designed for Tyser&Allan who specialise in special projects in regards to landscaping and event
draping. A couple of my good friends have recently joined forces and set up a business and I will now be 
making their website for them. The idea is to show off the amazing work they do and make a fully functioning
website that allows users to get in touch for quotes and/or buy merchandise that they are selling. 

You can get to my live site through the following link [https://tyser-allan.herokuapp.com/]

### Color scheme

![Color Scheme](static/images/colors.PNG)

I used a calming neutral set of colors as seen in the image. These colors are inline with
the brand and allow ease of use looking at the site. The color codes are as follows.
#7395AE
#5D5C61
#b1a296

I moved away from the green color from this picture as it wasn't very pleasing to the eye.

### Typogrophy

* I consistantly was using chrome web developer tools, however when push to my mobile found these to not be the most
accurate. The design was though out to ensure smaller screens were not squished and legible throughout. The layout

1. Create Name for App
2. Link the app to the GitHub repository by going to the "Deploy" tab in the main app menu.
3. Select a branch to deploy automatically
4. Pipenv to deal with my virtual enviroment and requirements.txt for dependancies
5. Create  "Procfile", needed by Heroku in order to know how to run the app
6. Connected to github with config values stored
7. All connected and up and running on Heroku's servers.
